== Sender attributes

Senders have attributes that can be retrieved with `get_env` in the same way as
querying a receiver's environment.

NOTE: Don't blame me for the name: it's in https://wg21.link/p2300[P2300].
Receivers have environments. Senders have attributes. Both are obtained by
calling `get_env`.

A sender's attributes often include its _completion scheduler_. In particular, a
sender obtained from calling `schedule` on a scheduler will always have that
scheduler as its completion scheduler. Perhaps that's clearer in code:

[source,cpp]
----
auto orig_sched = /* some scheduler */;
auto sndr = orig_sched.schedule();
auto sched = async::get_completion_scheduler(sndr);

assert(sched == orig_sched);
----

`get_completion_scheduler` uses `tag_invoke(get_completion_scheduler_t, S)` to
find the completion scheduler for a sender type `S`.
