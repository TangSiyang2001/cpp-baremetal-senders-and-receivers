== Completion signatures

Senders advertise the types that they may send.

One way to do this, for simple cases, is to expose a
`completion_signatures` typedef. This is a type list of function signatures
representing all the ways a sender may complete. The return type of each
signature signals whether it is a success, error or cancellation. Some trivial
examples:

[source,cpp]
----
// this just sends 42 (as if async::just(42))
struct just_42_sender {
  // ...
  // the only way it completes is by successfully sending an int
  using completion_signatures =
    async::completion_signatures<async::set_value_t(int)>;
};
----

[source,cpp]
----
// this just sends 42 (as if async::just(42)),
// but it may also error with an error_t
struct just_42_or_error_sender {
  // ...
  using completion_signatures =
    async::completion_signatures<async::set_value_t(int),
                                 async::set_error_t(error_t)>;
};
----

[source,cpp]
----
// this just sends 42 (as if async::just(42)),
// but it may also be stopped
struct just_42_or_stopped_sender {
  // ...
  using completion_signatures =
    async::completion_signatures<async::set_value_t(int),
                                 async::set_stopped_t()>;
};
----

Another way that senders can advertise their completions is through a query, which uses
https://wg21.link/p1895[tag_invoke]. It looks like this:

[source,cpp]
----
// this just sends 42 (as if async::just(42))
struct just_42_sender {
  // ...
  // the only way it completes is by successfully sending an int
  template <typename Env>
  [[nodiscard]] friend constexpr auto tag_invoke(async::get_completion_signatures_t,
                                                 just_42_sender const &,
                                                 Env const &)
    -> async::completion_signatures<async::set_value_t(int)> {
    return {};
  }
};
----

For a simple case like this both methods are equivalent. However, by using a
query a sender can send types dependent on an environment - and when a sender
connects to a receiver, the receiver provides that environment.
