== Customizing senders and receivers

The framework provides a general set of adaptors for composing senders. Users
will write their own senders, receivers, operation states, etc to provide for
individual use cases.

The basics to remember are:

- senders and receivers are movable (and probably copyable)
- operation states may be non-movable
- senders advertise what they send

Senders and receivers must always be movable. In particular, don't put
non-movable objects (e.g. atomic values, mutexes) into a receiver. The operation
state, which may be non-movable, is the place to put them.
