== Composing senders

Sender composition makes up most of what user code does. This is the process of
defining how tasks run with respect to each other, e.g. "run task A, then
forward what it returns to task B". To that end, there are three kinds of
functions in the library:

- sender _factories_: functions that return senders and represent entry points
  of asynchronous computation.
- sender _adaptors_: functions that take one or more senders and return a sender
  that is somehow the composition of them.
- sender _consumers_: functions that take a sender and actually kick off the
  asynchronous work.

IMPORTANT: Creating and composing senders _does not do any work_. Senders only
_describe_ a computation. After composing multiple senders into a sender, a
sender consumer will actually start the work.
