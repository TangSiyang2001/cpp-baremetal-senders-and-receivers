== Environments

An important mechanism for customization is the idea of an _environment_.
Environments are usually associated with receivers and the framework looks up
values in the environment by using https://wg21.link/p1895[tag_invoke]. In particular, the
framework calls `tag_invoke(get_env_t, R)` to find the environment of a receiver type
`R`, and `tag_invoke(get_stop_token_t, E)` to find the stop token of an environment
type E. `async::get_env_t` and `async::get_stop_token_t` are the tag types used for this
purpose.

In practice, here's what supporting that might look like for a custom receiver
that supports cancellation:

[source,cpp]
----
struct custom_receiver {
  auto set_value(auto&&...) { ... }
  auto set_error(auto&&) { ... }
  auto set_stopped() { ... }

  struct env {
    [[nodiscard]] friend constexpr auto tag_invoke(async::get_stop_token_t,
                                                   env const& e) -> async::in_place_stop_token {
      return e.token;
    }
    async::in_place_stop_token token;
  };

  [[nodiscard]] friend constexpr auto tag_invoke(async::get_env_t,
                                                 custom_receiver const& r) -> env {
    return {r.stop_source->get_token()};
  }

  in_place_stop_source* stop_source;
};
----

Given this, we can construct an arbitrary composition of senders with this as
the final receiver. If we want to cancel the operation, we call `request_stop()`
on the (external) `in_place_stop_source`. The internal senders, receivers and
operation states in the composition can observe this request by querying the
stop token in the environment for the final receiver, and this knowledge can
propagate through the sender-receiver chain.

NOTE: Remember that a receiver should not own a stop_source: receivers must
be movable, and in general a stop_source is not.
